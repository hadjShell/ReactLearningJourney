# React.js Note

***

## Components

* React is all about *Components*
* A component is a piece of the UI that has its own logic and appearance
* We don't have to manipulate DOM manually anymore with components
* **A component is just a JavaScript function**
* JSX
  * JavaScript XML
  * Writing markup with JSX
  * All tags must be closed
  * Component can't return multiple JSX tags
  * Component names must always start with a capital letter
  * Displaying data: `{}`
  * Passing data
    * Add attributes onto the custom HTML elements (components)
    * Components (the function) will accept one parameter as an object which holds all the received attributes
    * Conventionally the parameter is named with `props`
  * Composition of components
    * `{props.children}`
    * custom HTML elements can also have `className`
    *
